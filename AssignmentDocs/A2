As seen on the gamescreen.png there a a number of clickable elements on the game.html screen.
    - The help button
    - The seven color picker circles at the side of the playfield
    - The four circles currently in use for guessing the code

The help button will pop up a little gray screen with some text and an 'OK' or 'Continue' button and maybe some arrows 
to navigate the help menu if we have too much text to eplain the game.

The seven color picker/remover buttons will change the cursor into the circle that the user picks, in the case of the circle
with the cross in it, it will return the cursor to default and remove the selected color.

After clicking on one of the four currently in-use guessing slots the color of the selected circle will change into the color
of the current cursor, if the default cursor in in use the sidebar with the color pickers glows up briefly to indicate that
a color should be selected first.
