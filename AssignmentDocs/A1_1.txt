1.3) The X in both fields denotes that this field is not an http standard header field. The X-Cache is used by this server to indicate if the returned response was given to the user via use of a 'squid'/cache server or not.
1.4) Cache-control is used to direct the usage of the cache, in this case only the max age of the response is given. This indicates how old the message may be at maximum for it to still be of any use.
